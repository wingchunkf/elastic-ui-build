This is a mock UI built in React to display JSON data for Elastic Clusters. As I'm relatively  new to React, this is a very simple UI. In the future, I would like display only one cluster's data at a time, then add buttons or arrows to allow users to click through data for all 150 clusters.

This project utilizes yarn. Enter 'yarn start' in the command line to open development server.
