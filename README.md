This is a mock UI built in React to display JSON data. In the future, I would like to display only one cluster's data at a time. I would also like to add buttons or arrows to allow users to click through data for all 150 clusters.

My tools:
node v8.9.1
npm 5.8.0
yarn 1.3.2

Enter 'yarn start' in the command line to open development server.
